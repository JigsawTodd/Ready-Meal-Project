## Consumer Segmentation and Market Entry Analysis for RTE Meals
### Project Overview
This repository contains a data-driven analysis designed to support the UK market entry of a multinational food chain specializing in oriental-flavoured ready-to-eat (RTE) meals.

The project applies the COM-B framework (Capability–Opportunity–Motivation–Behaviour) to understand consumer preferences and behaviours toward RTE meal consumption. Using data from the Food Standards Agency’s official consumer survey, the analysis addresses three core objectives:

1. Segmentation: Identify distinct consumer clusters based on demographic, behavioural, and attitudinal variables.
2. Predictive Modeling: Build models to determine which factors significantly influence RTE meal consumption frequency.
3. Market Insights: Translate statistical findings into marketing strategies aligned with the 4P framework (Product, Place, Price, Promotion) for effective UK entry.
### Background & Motivation
Consumer adoption of RTE meals is influenced by capability (e.g., cooking skills, meal preparation frequency), opportunity (e.g., shopping habits, household responsibilities), and motivation (e.g., time pressure, preferences).
This project re-creates an academic assignment in Python, with the aim of demonstrating the ability to integrate consumer behaviour theory, data science techniques, and practical business recommendations for market entry strategies.
### Methodology
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Addressed missing values, formatted categorical and numerical variables, and engineered behavioural indicators.
- Statistical Analysis: Identified key drivers of consumption behaviour and quantified their effects.
- Unsupervised Learning: Applied clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical) to discover consumer segments with distinct preferences.
- Supervised Learning for Validation: Used classification models to test how well the clusters could be predicted, thereby providing an accuracy-based validation of the segmentation results.
- Supervised Learning: Built predictive models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.) to forecast RTE meal consumption frequency.
- Marketing Strategy: Mapped findings to the 4P framework to design actionable entry strategies.
### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Consumer segmentation and predictive analytics.
- Validation of cluster analysis using supervised learning accuracy metrics.
- Application of the COM-B framework to real-world consumer data.
- Proficiency in Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and modeling.
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Translating quantitative findings into business strategy recommendations.
